   <h1>My Hobby is Miniature Painting!</h1>
   <p>
    I enjoy spending my free time painting tiny figurines for a variety of games I play that utilize them. For example, in 'Dungeons and Dragons', the miniatures are markers for each individual player character and are chosen and painted to match their pictured appearance. Another game I paint miniatures for is 'Warhammer 40k', where vast armies of up to hundreds of models are organized on to huge tables with tanks, aircraft and more. 'Warhammer 40k' is a vast strategy game in which a match could take up to five hours of measuring distances and rolling die.
